# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game for two players. Players alternate turns to place `O` and `X` on a 3×3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, it's a **draw**.
